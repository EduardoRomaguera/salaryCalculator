Hello!
Thank you for checking my submission to the challenge. I had fun working on this and learn some useful stuff.

Project objectives:
 -Capture brute salary from human on a web formulary.
 -Process the salary info on a serverless API.
 -Show the response data to human on a web formulary.

Project has 2 layers:
	- UI is basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It makes a call to the API to process thee salary and do proper calculations.

	- API applies the embeded logic to make the calculations on salary deductions according to Costa RicaÂ´s law.

Code is available here:

You can access the web UI here:
